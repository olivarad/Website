                Olivia has been programming in Python since 2021 and has used Python to create a basic calculator, a text editor capable of fixing capitalization, replacing punctuation, shortening duplicate spaces, counting non-whitespace characters, giving a wordcount, reading text from a file, and saving edits to a file. Additionally, Olivia has used Python to create a scatter map capable of tracking the latitude, longitude, and magnitude of earthquakes around the globe.<br>
