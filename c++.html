                Olivia has been programming in C++ since 2015, starting with Arduino, a C++ based programming language used by programmable logic controllers. Olivia has used Arduino to create radio frequency-based controllers, personal displays on liquid crystal display screens, and a custom keyboard with Macro-programmable buttons. Olivia has gone on to extend the experience she gained with Arduino to make programs in C++. Some of these programs include an inventory management system for a commercial greenhouse, an Instagram profile manager using a custom dynamic array, a patient waitlist for a pharmacy using a singly linked list, a doubly linked list for use in applications involving RGB color swatches, and a C++ based implementation of the two-player boardgame "Boop."<br>
