            <h2>Welcome.</h2>
            <p>My name is Olivia Radecki and I'm a student at the Ohio University Russ College of Engineering, majoring in computer science. I have worked on various projects, like Knight's Harvest, a 2D sidescrolling platformer I'm actively developing in Unity. Another exciting project involves my macro keyboard where users can customize each button's function. I've also built numerous computers to meet user needs and I consistently perform maintenance to ensure their smooth operation. My passion for computer science drives me to continually expand my knowledge and skills and I am always eager to learn more.</p>
