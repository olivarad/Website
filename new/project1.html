        <h2>Future Changes</h2>
        <p>While this project is still a work in progress, my current efforts are directed towards bug fixes and refining features to enhance immersion. Once these improvements are implemented, the next phase will involve introducing additional content, with a primary focus on incorporating attacks, enemies, and damage. This will allow players to enjoy the game even in its incomplete state. Looking ahead, future developments will include the creation of physics-based puzzles featuring multiple solutions. This approach aims to reward players for their creativity while deeply immersing them in the intricacies of the game world's design. Furthermore, I anticipate extending the game world's map to include an expansive dungeon that incorporates interactable objects and formidable adversaries.</p>
